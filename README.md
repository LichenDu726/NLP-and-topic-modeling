# NLP-and-topic-modeling

**Motivation:**

This project did clustering on customers' reviews about watches and applied LDA and KNN algorithms to build model to assign the review to its relative topic group.


**Step1: Text preprocessing**
* Exclude stop words and text tokenization(1&2 gram) using NLTK tools


**Step2: Feature engineering**
* Applied TF-IDF to transfer text into feature matrix


**Step3: Model training**
* 5 means clutsering was used to divide those comments into 5 groups
* Build LDA model to do clusterig and find the top keywords for each topic
